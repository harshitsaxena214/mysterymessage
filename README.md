# 🕵️‍♂️ Mystery Message — Anonymous Messaging Platform

A full-stack web application that allows users to receive **anonymous messages** through a unique, shareable link.  
Built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, the platform focuses on privacy, security, and clean user experience.

Users sign up with a **unique username**, verify their account via a **verification code**, and then receive anonymous messages on their personal dashboard — with the sender’s identity always hidden.
